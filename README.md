# Automated File Organizer

A Python script for organizing files within a directory. When run, the script automatically sorts files into designated folders based on their type: web files are moved to a "Web" folder, pictures to a "Pictures" folder, videos to a "Videos" folder, documents to a "Documents" folder, compressed files to a "Compressed" folder, and audio files to an "Audio" folder. 

After usage it deletes itself.
